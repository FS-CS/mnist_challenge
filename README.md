# MNIST_challenge

A demonstration trial on the MNIST image set classification challenge where we use light Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures and simple methods to reach near state-of-the-art accuracies within short training times. We use the deep learning library PyTorch in a Jupyter notebook ran on Google Colab. GPU acceleration is enabled if available.
